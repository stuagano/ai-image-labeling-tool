## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
from document_processing.business_rules_manager import BusinessRulesManager
from document_processing.business_rules_engine import BusinessRulesEngine
from document_processing.interactive_workflow import WorkflowEngine

# Initialize the system
rules_engine = BusinessRulesEngine()
workflow_engine = WorkflowEngine()
rules_manager = BusinessRulesManager(rules_engine, workflow_engine)

# Validate a document
document_data = {
    "signature": {
        "coverage": 0.18,  # 18% coverage
        "ink_detected": True,
        "type": "handwritten"
    },
    "contract_amount": "125000.00",
    "client_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "document_type": "contract"
}

result = rules_manager.validate_document_with_specialized_rules(
    document_data, ValidationContext.USER_VALIDATION
)

print(f"Violations found: {result['total_violations']}")
for violation in result['violations']:
    print(f"- {violation.rule_name}: {violation.message}")
```

### Creating Validation Sessions

```python
# Start interactive validation for a document with violations
session = rules_manager.create_validation_session(
    user_id="reviewer_001",
    document_id="contract_2024_001", 
    violations=result['violations']
)

# Update a field during validation
rules_manager.update_field_in_session(
    session.id,
    field_name="contract_amount",
    old_value="",
    new_value="125000.00",
    user_notes="Corrected missing contract amount"
)

# Complete the validation session
rules_manager.complete_validation_session(
    session.id,
    session_notes="All critical issues resolved"
)
```

### Modifying Rules

```python
# Propose a rule modification (e.g., lower signature coverage threshold)
modification = rules_manager.propose_rule_modification(
    user_id="supervisor_001",
    rule_id="signature_contract_signature",
    modification_type=RuleModificationType.THRESHOLD_ADJUSTMENT,
    new_value={"required_coverage": 0.12},  # Lower from 15% to 12%
    reason="Based on document quality analysis, 12% provides adequate validation"
)

# Approve the modification
rules_manager.approve_rule_modification(
    modification.id,
    approver_id="supervisor_001", 
    approved=True,
    approval_notes="Approved based on business analysis"
)
```

## üîß Configuration Examples

### Custom Signature Rules

```python
# Create a custom signature rule for high-value contracts
high_value_signature = SignatureValidationRule(
    field_name="signature",
    required_coverage=0.25,  # 25% coverage for high-value contracts
    require_ink_detection=True,
    allow_digital_signature=False,  # Only handwritten for high-value
    signature_types=["handwritten"],
    validation_message="High-value contract requires enhanced signature validation"
)

rules_manager.signature_rules["high_value_contract"] = high_value_signature
```

### Custom Field Requirements

```python
# Create a field requirement for contract terms
contract_terms_rule = FieldRequirementRule(
    field_name="contract_terms",
    required=False,
    conditional_requirements=[
        {
            "field": "contract_amount", 
            "operator": "greater_than",
            "value": 50000,
            "description": "contract amount exceeds $50,000"
        }
    ],
    min_length=10,
    validation_message="Contract terms required for contracts over $50,000"
)

rules_manager.field_requirement_rules["contract_terms"] = contract_terms_rule
```

## üîÑ Interactive Validation Workflow

- Tasks are automatically assigned to appropriate users based on:
  - User role and skills
  - Current workload
  - Violation severity

### 3. Interactive Resolution
- Users can:
  - **Update field values** with real-time re-validation
  - **Approve exceptions** for low-severity violations
  - **Propose rule modifications** for recurring issues
  - **Escalate to supervisors** for complex cases
  - **Request document reprocessing** with enhanced algorithms

### 4. Completion and Approval
- Session completed when all critical violations resolved
- Document approved and moved to next workflow stage
