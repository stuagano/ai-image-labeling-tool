contract_rule = BusinessRule(
    id="contract_amount_validation",
    name="Contract Amount Approval Threshold",
    description="Contracts over $1M require supervisor approval",
    rule_type=RuleType.VALIDATION,
    severity=RuleSeverity.CRITICAL,
    conditions=[
        {"field": "contract_amount", "operator": "greater_than", "value": 1000000},
        {"field": "document_type", "operator": "equals", "value": "contract"}
    ],
    validation_message="Contract amount exceeds $1M approval threshold",
    suggested_action="Route to supervisor for approval",
    tags=["financial", "approval_required"]
)
```

### Issue Detection and Resolution

```python
# Automatic issue detection
issues = issue_detector.detect_issues(field_results, template_fields)

# Example detected issues:
# - Low confidence field extraction (Customer name: 0.4 confidence)
# - Missing required signature field
# - Date format validation failure
# - OCR errors in text fields

# Automated resolution attempts
for issue in issues:
    resolution = issue_resolver.resolve_issue(issue, context)
    if resolution['fully_resolved']:
        print(f"‚úÖ Automatically resolved: {issue.title}")
    else:
        # Create workflow task for human review
        task = workflow_engine.create_task_from_issue(issue)
```

### Workflow Management for Complex Cases

```python
# Intelligent task assignment based on user skills and workload
user = WorkflowUser(
    id="specialist_001",
    name="Legal Document Specialist",
    role=UserRole.SPECIALIST,
    skills=["legal_documents", "contract_review", "compliance"],
    max_concurrent_tasks=5
)

# Task automatically routed to appropriate specialist
